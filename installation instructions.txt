===== Installation instructions =====
=====================================

1. Requirements
	- php 7.1 php7.1-mysql php7.1-mcrypt php7.1-gd php7.1-mbstring php7.1-xml
		(In order to install these, I had to add 
		"deb http://mirrordirector.raspbian.org/raspbian/ buster main contrib non-free rpi"
		to my /etc/apt/sources.list file).
	- mysql-server (Whatever server software you typically use ought to work as well, if php normally interacts with it
	- libapache2-mod-php7.1
	- apache2

2. Steps
	- Clone repository (https://github.com/ryan-shah/CS499.git) to /var/www/html
	- Change the ownership of the CS499 directory to "www-data" (or whatever the 'user' is that owns the /var/www directory is)
	- Change directory to CS499/spydr
	- run "sudo composer install"
	- Under /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/000-default.conf, add this:


     	<Directory />
        	Options FollowSymLinks
                AllowOverride None
        </Directory>
      	<Directory /var/www/CS499/spydr/public/>
                AllowOverride All
	</Directory>
	

	- In the spydr/.env, change the "DB_*" lines to match your database configuration
	- Run "php artisan migrate" to create the necessary database tables
	- Done. The website can be accessed at www.<root-domain>.com/CS499/spydr/public
		- The public/.htaccess file should already be configured.
