CS 499 Project

Assuming you have composer already installed, there are a few things you'll have to do to be able to run this with php artisan.

1. ```composer install```
2. ```php artisan key:generate```
3. ```php artisan serve```

If the server starts and the webpage appears correctly at the address (probably localhost:8000), then you're good to go.
